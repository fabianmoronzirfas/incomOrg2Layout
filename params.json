{"name":"Incomorg2layout","body":"#incom.org to layout  \r\nthis is the source code for importing data generated from incom.org into indesign. \r\n## Getting Started \r\n1. **The incom.org API is still in alpha phase. so i can't gibe the keys away yet.** If you are a student at the FHP talk to the Incom-Admins how to get your hands on that data. Than you can connect me and i show you how to get your data to work.  \r\nIf you still want to try out some of the scripts you can download the files i've used to build my documentation.  \r\nGet them over [here](http://fabiantheblind.info/downloads/incomOrg2Layout.zip)  \r\n\r\n2. look into the folder \"latest\" there is all that matters. \r\n \r\n3. **First of all use the script:** \"START_HERE_inspect_meta.jsx\"\"  \r\nIt has the basic components of all scripts.  \r\n**You need to use the ExtendScript Toolkit from Adobe to see the output.**   \r\nRun the \"allIncomProjects.jsx\" and afterwards the \"connect_projects.jsx\" or have a look into \"getDataFromJSON_v01.jsx\" to get started.\r\nMaybe you run the file \"rectangle_images.jsx\".   \r\n\r\n##The Runnable Scripts \r\nSTART_HERE_inspect_meta.jsx    \r\nallIncomProjects.jsx  \r\n- connect_projects.jsx -> depends on allIncomProjects.jsx  \r\nbook.jsx  \r\n- book_build_index.jsx -> depends on book.jsx  \r\ncircle_images.jsx  \r\ncircle_text.jsx  \r\nindex_allProjects.jsx    \r\nrectangle_images.jsx    \r\ngetDataFromJSON_v01.jsx    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n##The Utility files without own execution:\r\ncolors.jsx // builds the colors  \r\ndb_utils.jsx  // utilities to get data from the db.json\r\ndb.json  // this holds all the data from incom\r\ndocument.jsx  // builds up a document\r\nstyles.jsx  // build paragraph and character styles\r\nutility.jsx  // some stuff like sorting by data\r\nweblinks.jsx  // this builds weblinks from text very useful\r\n\r\n##License\r\nAll content is under GPLv3 License ","tagline":"This is some code that generates indesign documents from json data taken from incom.org","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
