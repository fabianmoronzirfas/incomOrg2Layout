#incom.org to layout  
this is the source code for importing data generated from incom.org into indesign.  
look int othe folder "latest" there is all that matters.
run the "allIncomProjects.jsx" and afterwards the "connect_projects.jsx". They could be moved into one script but there should be a break to make some manual tweaks.

the files "db_util.jsx" and "utility.jsx" contain some functions that get used in both scripts.
